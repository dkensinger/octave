%% Machine Learning Online Class - Exercise 3 | Part 2: Neural Networks

%  Instructions
%  ------------
% 
%  This file contains code that helps you get started on the
%  linear exercise. You will need to complete the following functions 
%  in this exericse:
%
%     lrCostFunction.m (logistic regression cost function)
%     oneVsAll.m
%     predictOneVsAll.m
%     predict.m
%
%  For this exercise, you will not need to change any code in this file,
%  or any other files other than those mentioned above.
%

%% Initialization
clear ; close all; clc

%% Setup the parameters you will use for this exercise
input_layer_size  = 400;  % 20x20 Input Images of Digits
hidden_layer_size = 25;   % 25 hidden units
num_labels = 10;          % 10 labels, from 1 to 10   
                          % (note that we have mapped "0" to label 10)

%% =========== Part 1: Loading and Visualizing Data =============
%  We start the exercise by first loading and visualizing the dataset. 
%  You will be working with a dataset that contains handwritten digits.
%

% Load Training Data
fprintf('Loading and Visualizing Data ...\n')

load('ex3data1.mat');
m = size(X, 1);

% Randomly select 100 data points to display
sel = randperm(size(X, 1));
sel = sel(1:100);

displayData(X(sel, :));

fprintf('Program paused. Press enter to continue.\n');
pause;

%% ================ Part 2: Loading Pameters ================
% In this part of the exercise, we load some pre-initialized 
% neural network parameters.

fprintf('\nLoading Saved Neural Network Parameters ...\n')

% Load the weights into variables Theta1 and Theta2
load('ex3weights.mat');

%% ================= Part 3: Implement Predict =================
%  After training the neural network, we would like to use it to predict
%  the labels. You will now implement the "predict" function to use the
%  neural network to predict the labels of the training set. This lets
%  you compute the training set accuracy.

pred = predict(Theta1, Theta2, X);

fprintf('\nTraining Set Accuracy: %f\n', mean(double(pred == y)) * 100);

fprintf('Program paused. Press enter to continue.\n');
pause;

%  To give you an idea of the network's output, you can also run
%  through the examples one at the a time to see what it is predicting.

%  Randomly permute examples
rp = randperm(m);

for i = 1:m
    % Display 
    fprintf('\nDisplaying Example Image\n');
    displayData(X(rp(i), :));

    pred = predict(Theta1, Theta2, X(rp(i),:));
    fprintf('\nNeural Network Prediction: %d (digit %d)\n', pred, mod(pred, 10));
    
    % Pause with quit option
    s = input('Paused - press enter to continue, q to exit:','s');
    if s == 'q'
      break
    end
end

** Can you write a paragraph without the letter 'E'?
   Entered on [2017-08-07 Mon 14:18]
   notes: I doubt I can. It’s a major part of many, many words. Omitting it is as hard as making muffins without flour. It’s as hard as spitting without saliva, napping without a pillow, driving a train without tracks, sailing to Russia without a boat, or washing your hands without soap. And, anyway, what would I gain? An award? A cash bonus? Bragging rights? Why should I strai n my brain? It’s not worth doing. Now, a grammatical paragraph without commas: that would wow most folks, don’t you think? Could you do it? If so, I tip my hat to you—or I would if I had a hat. Or, how about a paragraph without punctuation? Or a paragraph without nouns? If you can do that, you’ll win my admiration. Go on. Try! I’m waiting…
** Neal Stephenson quote on emacs
   Entered on [2017-09-03 Sun 21:23]
   notes: [...] I use emacs, which might be thought of as a thermonuclear word processor. It was created by Richard Stallman; enough said. It is written in Lisp, which is the only computer language that is beautiful. It is colossal, and yet it only edits straight ASCII text files, which is to say, no fonts, no boldface, no underlining. In other words, the engineer-hours that, in the case of Microsoft Word, were devoted to features like mail merge, and the ability to embed feature-length motion pictures in corporate memoranda, were, in the case of emacs, focused with maniacal intensity on the deceptively simple-seeming problem of editing text. If you are a professional writer—i.e., if someone else is getting paid to worry about how your words are formatted and printed—emacs outshines all other editing software in approximately the same way that the noonday sun does the stars. It is not just bigger and brighter; it simply makes everything else vanish.
